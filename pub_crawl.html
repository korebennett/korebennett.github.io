        <p class="paragraph"> Welcome to the ultimate Edinburgh pub crawl. This is a collection of the 10 pubs around
            the
            city which I think, together, would make a banging pub crawl for those brave enough to take it on. I think
            that
            if you were just visiting the city it would also give you a fairly comprehensive overview of the pubs of
            Edinburgh. From more traditional old-man pubs to wacky ones to those that just have amazing beer.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">This is certainly not an exhaustive list of my favourite pubs in the city, but it contains
            most
            of them and this made a nice, neat circle. It also contains one which you can’t really call a pub but it’s
            so
            beautiful inside and has such a nice vibe that I've included it anyway – it also helpfully bridged the gap
            between Old Town and New Town.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Of course, due to the circular nature of the crawl, one could pretty much start anywhere
            but I
            think if it was me I’d start early at The Argyle, mainly because I live in Marchmont so it’s convenient and
            also
            it’s a really relaxed environment, and just a nice starting point. So, quick stroke of the inevitable
            congregation of the dogs of Marchmont and we’re off. <strong>Quick interjection for a disclaimer</strong>
            I’ve
            tried to limit walking time between pubs to a maximum of around 15 minutes, with the longest time being
            right in
            the middle of the crawl between Jackson’s and Fierce, which is the perfect time to buy mid-crawl chocolate
            from
            the Sainsbury’s on Rose Street before the second act kicks off.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Ok, back to our regularly scheduled programming. Right, Argyle done, onto Newington. First
            stop, on South Clerk Street, The Southern. This pub is one of those places that I always wanted to go
            because it
            looks so nice from the outside. And, conveniently enough, the beer selection is excellent which makes it all
            the
            more appealing. I think it’s a somewhat hotspot for the upwardly mobile late twenties crowd, but the vibes
            are
            excellent, even if it is normally quite busy.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Let’s keep moving, next stop, The Dog House. This is one of the coolest pubs I’ve ever been
            to,
            perhaps on par with Paradise Palms, which is definitely a notable mention! If you imagine the pub
            manifestation
            of those stealable Beavertown glasses you’d be on the right track. There’s someone there who keeps ferrets
            but
            don’t let that put you off, they do events during the week like Open Mic nights, and I think they even have
            DJs
            on a Saturday night so based on your proclivities one could avoid those nights or work them into your plans.
            The
            beer isn’t cheap but it’s nice, there’s cuddly toys on the ceiling and games you can borrow, what’s not to
            like?
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">Moving away from Old Town now and into New Town, we have an extremely underrated pub which
            I
            first visited with Beer Society and has one of the most impressive selections of beer in the city. Simply
            for
            that reason, it makes the list. In places like this, utilise the fact they let you try things!!! Don’t end
            up
            with a pint of some strange Cask Ale which is kept at cellar temperature (something which I view as
            personally
            offensive, sue me). Anyway, enjoy the quieter, more chill vibes here before leaving Old Town and venturing
            into
            the centre!</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Onto one of my personal favourites and somewhat of a hidden gem, right under the nose of
            Prince’s Street. Jackson the Tailor. Connected to The Newsroom restaurant (the food here is really good,
            don’t
            be too put off by the location), this place is absolutely gorgeous. It’s all red and kind of dark, it makes
            you
            feel SO rich just being there. It genuinely looks like something out of a film; even the menus are
            beautifully
            designed. Now, of course this place is a notable diversion from the general pub vibes I’ve been pursuing
            thus
            far, BUT, I think it’s worth it because it’s beautiful and if you only have one cocktail, it won’t break the
            bank. I really think Jackson’s is underrated because it’s tucked away so well. However, a benefit of this is
            that you can pretty much always get a seat!</p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Ok, half-way through. After Jackson’s, it’s time for a nice walk down Rose Street which I actually really
            like. There
            are a multitude of other pubs along Rose St you could definitely visit if you wanted to break up the 15 mins
            with a
            quick one which is nice, but I personally would go to Sainsbury’s and fuel up for the second half.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Fierce is next and one of my absolute favourites in terms of beer. Also, I think what my boyfriend would
            choose as
            his favourite for the same reason, he goes feral for the lime lager, and it really is good. There’s not even
            really
            much to say beyond that. The beer is absolutely brilliant, they have TV screens which list all of them, it’s
            a nice
            vibe inside and it’s just a great pub.
        </p>


        <p class="paragraph">
            Ok, the next ones I’m going to move through a bit quicker because at the end of the day, a pub is a pub and
            there’s
            only so many ways to describe them. Number 6 is a Spoons, which I always think a pub crawl should have at
            least one
            of. You can get some food, enjoy some cheap pints or a Diet Coke to keep you going and the Caley Picture
            House is
            also in an old Art Deco Cinema which is actually really pretty. Moving swiftly on, Innes and Gunn. Another
            fab beer
            selection, their Lager is only £3.75 with a student discount, it’s a solid choice for any good pub evening
            and
            certainly a recent favourite of me and my friends.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            At Number 8 is The Ventoux. Now, as my flatmates and anyone else who is around when this pub is mentioned, I
            have a
            bit of a love hate relationship with it. The pub is kind of an indiscriminate vibe, it has bikes on the
            ceiling and
            vintage cycling jerseys on the walls which doesn’t immediately lead one to think it would be the hotspot for
            really
            cool people, but there you go. I was told recently that it’s because it’s so close to the Art school and
            obvs
            artists are really cool so it does actually make sense. In addition to people watching and outfit planning
            based on
            what the artsy people are wearing, it is actually a nice vibe. You can order really good pizza, they serve
            Cruzcampo
            which is really nice and they have cool posters on the wall on the way down to the toilet which my flatmate
            likes to
            steal and put on her wall at home.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Home stretch now and onto what I think is my favourite pub in the city. It’s old, it’s beautiful, it’s got a
            cute
            little snug room at the front, which is teasingly unavailable, it’s literally got my name on it.... It’s
            Bennet’s.
            Not much more really needs saying about this place, it’s got that lovely old-man pub, comforting, warm vibes
            and
            it’s a great place for the end of a pub crawl, and a couple of slower drinks for the end of the night. The
            beers
            nice, the setting’s nice, even if you’re pissed because of the 9 other pubs, you can’t go to Bennet’s and
            not enjoy
            it, even if you have to stand at the bar.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Finally, I want to just slide in my notable mentions, because, despite their lack of entry into this crawl,
            they are
            still worth a visit. No.1 Paradise Palms. As I mentioned earlier, this place is so cool, it’s vibrant, the
            cocktails
            are fabulous they do really cool events, what more could you want? And finally, honourable mention No.2 Cold
            Town
            House. Especially in the summer, this place would be a great addition to any pub crawl. It’s on Grassmarket
            so it’s
            touristy but Cold Town Brewery makes nice beer and it’s actually not that expensive (by Edinburgh
            standards). If you
            do manage to go when its warm, sit on the rooftop terrace. It’s got one of the best views of the castle, you
            can sit
            in a cable car, and they have heaters for when it gets a bit chillier. Another thing I particularly enjoy
            about the
            addition of Paradise Palms and Cold Town is that it makes the crawl sinch in the middle, transforming the
            circle
            into an hourglass – get it girl.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            So, there it is, my 10-pub crawl through Edinburgh. As I said, its not an exhaustive list but it would
            certainly make for an exhausting evening, and I think it effectively captures the essence of Edinburgh's pub
            offerings. Anyway, I hope you’ve enjoyed this slightly all over the place first instalment So, If you’ve
            made it this far, thank you for reading and I hope you come back for a future post!
